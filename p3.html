  <p><ins> Swift </ins>
  is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language developed by Apple Inc. for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, Linux, and z/OS. Swift is designed to work with Apple's Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks and the large body of existing Objective-C code written for Apple products. It is built with the open source LLVM compiler framework and has been included in Xcode since version 6, released in 2014. On Apple platforms,  it uses the Objective-C runtime library which allows C, Objective-C, C++ and Swift code to run within one program.</p>

  <p><ins> Java</ins>
   decreased in popularity by about 6,000 job postings going into 2018 compared to going into 2017, the analysis found. However, it is still an extremely well-established language, used by millions of developers and billions of devices worldwide. Additionally, all Android apps are based on Java, and 90% of Fortune 500 companies use Java as a server-side language for backend development, Misirlakis noted.</p>

  <p><ins> Python</ins>
   grew in popularity by about 5,000 job postings since last year. It's commonly used in scientific computing, data mining, and machine learning--and the growth in demand for machine learning developers in particular may be driving some of its popularity, Misirlakis wrote.</p>
