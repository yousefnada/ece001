  <p>  Communication is very vital in any given environment. Be it among human beings or electronic systems. The need to fully communicate with the computer system has since left the world with numerous types of computer programming languages which cannot be discussed exhaustively at this stage. However, there are those types of computer programming languages which have proved to be very out standing among the hundreds of the existing programming languages.  </p> 

 <p>  There is no set standard of classifying thee types of computer programming languages as they vary in performance as well as the structure. All the exiting types of computer programming languages can be broadly classified as machine language, assembly language or high level language. However it should be understood at this early stage that a computer understands only the machine language. Therefore, thereâ€™s need to use assemblers and compilers while using other types of computer programming languages.</p>

  <p>Machine language is rarely used due to its slow rate and cumbersome in nature. It uses two binary digits; 0 and 1 where 1 represents presence of electrical signals while 0 absences of electrical signals. Therefore type of computer programming language is also referred to as the binary languag </p>
